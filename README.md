# Seasonal Trends in Web Search Interest for "House Pet" and "House Plant"
## Abstract
Web search trends provide valuable insights into consumer behavior and interests. In this study, we analyze the seasonal trends in search interest for "house pet" and "house plant" in Canada using weekly time series data. We employ the seasonal decomposition of time series (STL) method to isolate and examine seasonal patterns in search interest. Our findings reveal recurring patterns of peaks and troughs in search interest for both "house pet" and "house plant," suggesting the presence of seasonal trends. These patterns may be associated with factors such as holidays, seasonal changes, and marketing campaigns. Understanding seasonal trends in search interest can inform businesses, marketers, and researchers on consumer behavior related to pets and plants.

## 1. Introduction
Web search trends are a powerful tool for understanding the interests, preferences, and behavior of consumers. As individuals use search engines to find information and make decisions, search trends reflect the collective interests of the population. By analyzing search trends, businesses, marketers, and researchers can gain insights into the timing and magnitude of consumer demand for specific products or topics.

In this study, we analyze the seasonal trends in search interest for "house pet" and "house plant" in Canada. The objective is to identify recurring patterns in search interest that may be associated with seasonal factors, such as holidays, weather changes, and marketing campaigns. To achieve this, we use weekly web search trend data and employ the seasonal decomposition of time series (STL) method to isolate and examine the seasonal patterns.

This paper is organized as follows: Section 2 describes the data and methodology used for the analysis. Section 3 presents the results and visualizations of the search trends and seasonal decomposition. Section 4 provides a discussion and interpretation of the findings. Finally, Section 5 concludes the paper and highlights potential areas for future research.

## 2. Data and Methodology
The data used in this study consists of weekly web search trends for "house pet" and "house plant" in Canada. The search trend values are represented as relative search interest, with a higher value indicating higher search interest. The data covers a time period starting from May 1, 2022.

To analyze seasonal trends, we employ the seasonal decomposition of time series (STL) method. The STL method is a robust and flexible technique for decomposing time series data into its trend, seasonal, and residual components. By examining the seasonal components, we can identify recurring patterns or cycles in search interest.

## 3. Results
We begin by visualizing the time series data for "house pet" and "house plant" search trends. Figure 1 shows the search trends over time, with time on the x-axis and search interest on the y-axis. We observe that the search interest for both queries fluctuates over the weeks, with peaks and troughs suggesting the presence of seasonal patterns.

```python
# Generate the line plot for search trends
plt.figure(figsize=(12, 6))
plt.plot(search_trends_df['Week'], search_trends_df['House Pet Search Trend'], label='House Pet Search Trend')
plt.plot(search_trends_df['Week'], search_trends_df['House Plant Search Trend'], label='House Plant Search Trend')

# Add labels and title
plt.xlabel('Week')
plt.ylabel('Search Interest')
plt.title('Figure 1: Search Trends for "House Pet" and "House Plant"')
plt.legend()

# Show the plot
plt.show()

# Generate the seasonal decomposition plot for "house pet"
plt.figure(figsize=(12, 6))
stl_pet = STL(search_trends_df['House Pet Search Trend'], seasonal=13, period=4)
result_pet = stl_pet.fit()
fig_pet = result_pet.plot(observed=False, resid=False)
fig_pet.suptitle('Figure 2: Seasonal Decomposition for "House Pet" Search Trends', fontsize=14, y=1.05)
plt.tight_layout()
plt.show()

# Generate the seasonal decomposition plot for "house plant"
plt.figure(figsize=(12, 6))
stl_plant = STL(search_trends_df['House Plant Search Trend'], seasonal=13, period=4)
result_plant = stl_plant.fit()
fig_plant = result_plant.plot(observed=False, resid=False)
fig_plant.suptitle('Figure 3: Seasonal Decomposition for "House Plant" Search Trends', fontsize=14, y=1.05)
plt.tight_layout()
plt.show()
```

The decomposition results confirm the presence of seasonal patterns in search interest for both "house pet" and "house plant." These patterns may be associated with factors such as holidays, seasonal changes, or marketing campaigns.

## 4. Discussion
Our analysis of web search trends reveals seasonal patterns in search interest for both "house pet" and "house plant." The recurring patterns of peaks and troughs in search interest suggest that consumer behavior related to pets and plants may be influenced by seasonal factors.

For "house pet" search trends, the repeating cycle in search interest may be associated with pet-related events, holidays, or weather changes. For example, people may search for pet-related products or services during specific holidays or when the weather changes and outdoor activities become more feasible.

Similarly, the recurring pattern in "house plant" search trends may be influenced by gardening seasons, holidays, or indoor plant care activities. The search interest for "house plant" may peak during specific months when people engage in gardening or purchase plants for indoor decoration.

Understanding seasonal trends in search interest can provide valuable insights for businesses, marketers, and researchers. Businesses can use this information to optimize their product offerings and marketing strategies to align with seasonal patterns. Marketers can tailor their campaigns to maximize reach and engagement during peak search interest periods. Researchers can further explore the factors driving seasonal trends and their impact on consumer behavior.

## 5. Conclusion
In this study, we analyzed seasonal trends in web search interest for "house pet" and "house plant" in Canada. Our analysis revealed recurring patterns in search interest, suggesting the presence of seasonal trends. These patterns may be associated with holidays, seasonal changes, or marketing campaigns.

Understanding seasonal trends in search interest can inform businesses, marketers, and researchers on consumer behavior related to pets and plants. By aligning product offerings and marketing strategies with seasonal patterns, businesses can enhance their performance and meet consumer demand.

Future research could explore the factors driving seasonal trends, the impact of marketing campaigns on search interest, and the relationship between search trends and consumer behavior. Additionally, similar analyses could be conducted for other search queries or geographic regions to gain broader insights into seasonal trends in web search interest.
